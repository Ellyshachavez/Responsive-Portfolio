                <p class="text-secondary"> I'm Ellysha, and I'm currently working as a full time Business Systems Engineer for a Mortgage Company and creating projects for you to view <a href="port.html">here</a>. As I gradually climb my way up the corporate ladder and the men who rule it, I have gratefully fallen into this passion of solving problems and creating even better solutions. Although, I had always imagined myself out in a field, saving endangered species... I couldn't get past the hell and fury of chemistry and calculus. So, while some dreams turn to hobbies, my bills turned me to a 9-5 call center job that I grew into becoming an Engineer? Crazy. It was, however, my attention to detail that I have now found my self gettin' technical.</p>

                <p class="text-secondary">While my demanding job and now bootcamp class has preoccupied my time, these are not the activities that define me but help mold me. In my free time, you’ll find me catching z’s, with my dog, hiking, or at a brewery. Sours, have recently turned into my sinful pleasure.</p>

                <p class="text-secondary">Suspendisse dictum, arcu at convallis faucibus, quam sapien tincidunt nunc, sit amet egestas nibh tortor et mi. Orci varius natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.</p>
